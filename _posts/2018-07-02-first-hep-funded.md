The NSF ["Training-based Workforce Development for Advanced Cyberinfrastructure  (CyberTraining)"](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505342) program has awarded $500k to the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez (UPRM) and Princeton University for a 3-year collaborative research project entitled "Framework for Integrated Research Software Training in High Energy Physics (FIRST-HEP)". FIRST-HEP aims to develop a community framework for software training to prepare the scientific and engineering workforce needed for the computing challenges of HEP experiments.

[Sudhir Malik](http://charma.uprm.edu/~malik/) of UPRM will be the lead PI 
for the project, in collaboration with [Peter Elmer](https://scholar.princeton.edu/elmer) and [Ian Cosden](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/people/ian-cosden-0) from Princeton University. FIRST-HEP will also collaborate with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and the [HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/).
