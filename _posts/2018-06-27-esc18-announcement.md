**X edition of the School ESC (Efficient Scientific Computing)**

**Bertinoro - Italy 22 - 27 October 2018**

The tenth edition of the INFN International School on "Architectures, tools
and methodologies for developing efficient large scale scientific computing
applications"

**ESC18 - EFFICIENT SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING**

will be held in Bertinoro (Forli cesena, Italy) from the 22nd to the 27th
October 2018.

The aim of the ESC school is to offer the participants the opportunity
to improve their computing competences, learning from qualified and
experiences scientists how to best exploit modern hardware and
software technologies in their daily scientific work.
The program proposes introductory lectures on trends in hardware
architectures and parallel programming, with more in-depth lessons
on modern C++, effective memory usage, floating-point computation
and programming in a heterogeneous world combining multi-threading,
GPUs and clusters.

The school is mostly targeted to PhD students, post-docs and young
researchers who are actively involved with the development of
scientific applications and systems. Familiarity and experience
with basic concepts of modern OO languages, in particular with C++
language, are desirable prerequisites to attend the school.

The program of this year is structured along two main tracks:

*The basics of efficient programming:*

  * Modern processor architectures
  * Efficient floating-point computation
  * Tools and methodologies for improved performance
  * Efficient exploitation of modern C++
  * Managing memory usage

*Parallel programming for scientific applications:*

  * Heterogeneous architectures
  * Threading Building Blocks programming
  * Effective vectorization
  * GP-GPU programming with CUDA
  * Cluster computing with MPI

Lectures will be interspersed with tutorial and practical sessions,
providing opportunities for direct applications of optimization tools
and technologies as well as for interactions among students, lecturers and
tutors.

Further information to apply to ESC18 are available on the school web site:
