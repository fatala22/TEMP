High energy physics research aims to make discoveries which provide
a deeper understanding of the fundamental building blocks of nature
and their interactions. 
The most successful theory to date is known as the 
["Standard Model"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) 
of particle physics.
Although it describes the vast majority of experimental observations
to date, it is known to be an incomplete description of nature, and
the search for experimental results which illuminate what lies
"Beyond the Standard Model" behind the operation of many current
HEP experiments as well as the design of the large, next-generation,
facilities. The latter includes the [
[High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)](https://home.cern/topics/high-luminosity-lhc)
at [CERN](https://home.cern/) and the 
[Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF)](https://lbnf.fnal.gov/) at 
[Fermilab](http://fnal.gov/).
Doing the science at
both these large facilities and smaller experiments often requires complex 
experimental apparatus capable of collecting enormous data samples, as well 
as sophisticated software and computing systems capable of analyzing these 
samples.


Training is central to building the community skills needed to address the computing challenges of the HL-LHC era. One key insight is the need to think of training not as a set of individual, disconnected activities, but as part of a larger framework, as shown in Figure 4.
