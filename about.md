High energy physics research aims to make discoveries which provide
a deeper understanding of the fundamental building blocks of nature
and their interactions. 
The most successful theory to date is known as the 
["Standard Model"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) 
of particle physics.
Although it describes an impressive number of experimental observations
to date, it is known to be an incomplete description of nature. 
The search for what lies "Beyond the Standard Model" is the 
[scientific driver](https://www.usparticlephysics.org/) for many ongoing
experiments as well as the design of the large, next-generation
facilities. The latter includes the
[High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)](https://home.cern/topics/high-luminosity-lhc)
at [CERN](https://home.cern/) and the 
[Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF)](https://lbnf.fnal.gov/) at 
[Fermilab](http://fnal.gov/).

Doing the science at
both the planned large facilities and smaller experiments often requires 
collecting enormous data samples and the development of 
*sophisticated software* capable of analyzing the experimental data.
People are the key to developing successful research software. 
The Framework for Integrated Research Software Training in High Energy Physics (FIRST-HEP) aims to develop a community framework for software training to prepare the scientific and engineering workforce needed for the computing challenges of high-energy physics experiments. 

Training is central to building the skills needed to address the computing challenges of the HL-LHC era. 

One key insight is the need to think of training not as a set of individual, disconnected activities, but as part of a larger framework, as shown in Figure 4.
